DeerHud is a complete hud designed around pixel art and general pixel aesthetics. this hud features a lot of custom sprites and artwork created by me. I feel like the hud market is pretty stale in terms of styles and im hoping to bring something fresh to the table. if you like you can download the full res background images and use them as wallpapers. https://imgur.com/a/vRWfiKj

Note: This Hud might not look perfect on odd resolutions or screens that aren't 16:9, but there are some fixes if you play in 4:3
