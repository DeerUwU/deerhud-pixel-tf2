**DeerHud** is a complete tf2 hud designed around pixel art and general pixel aesthetics. this hud features a lot of custom sprites and artwork created by me. I felt like the hud market is pretty stale in terms of styles and im hoping to bring something fresh to the table. if you like you can [download](https://imgur.com/a/vRWfiKj) the full res background images and use them as wallpapers.
